# About myself


# Introduce myself

A common Chinese university student majored in Industrial AI

I am studying **Mathematics**, **Computer Science,** and **English**(and i want to learn other languages) 

I like freedom, so I don't let anyone deter me from chasing my dream!

I like digital products, and I want to be a geek.

I am not a fat geek and don't want to be fat, so I like sports, working out (muscle building), basketball, and aerobic exercise like swimming and running.

*Maybe I will add something more one day...*

# About myself


# Introduce myself

A general Chinese university student in science and technology

Studying **Mathematics**, **Computer Science** and **English**(I hope that after I learn English I can also learn other languages) 

Like freedom, so I don't let anyone stop chasing my dream!

Like some digital products, want to be a geek

Not a fat geek and don't want to be one, So I like sports, work out (muscle building), basketball, and some aerobics like swimming and running

*Maybe I will add something more one day...*
